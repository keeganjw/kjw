		My name is Keegan Woodward and I currently work as an IT specialist for the State of Vermont. My job
		requires me to be a jack of all trades
		but I am looking to specialize in web development. While working as a system administrator, my role expanded
		to include developing
		the department's work order management website almost full-time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Throughout this process, I worked extensively with the front-end tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
		jQuery.
		On the back-end, I used C# and the .NET Framework. Web development isn't new to me. Experimenting with it in
		high school is what made me pursue computer science
		as a major in college. I want to continue that pursuit as a career.
